# Predictive-maintenance-of-Industrial-Equipment
1.Background 
1.1	Aim
We are clear on our view that we want to make a model that is capable of detecting the failure of an equipment way before the actual failure.
The dataset that we have has been taken from the industry itself and has all the actual features that is needed to satisfy our goal.
We will be targeting Solar Panel for our project and at the end our model will be capable of informing failure of any panel prior to its actual failure.

1.2	Technologies
The project involves two main steps: preprocessing and prediction. For both steps, the technology used is python, a popular and versatile programming language. Preprocessing involves cleaning, transforming and analyzing the data to make it suitable for the prediction step. Prediction involves applying a machine learning model to the preprocessed data to generate the desired output. Python offers many libraries and tools for both preprocessing and prediction, such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and tensorflow.
